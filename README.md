# ISS (Signals and Systems)
## Course Description
The course's goal is to teach the students basic  theory of signals and linear systems. Student should understand terms (theoreticaly and practically) such as Spectral Analysis, DFT, convolution, linear filtering etc.

## Project
The main task is to analyse given audio file. The file contains four interfering cosinus signals that should be detected and filtered.

# Language
Python3

# Project results
The results are described in [this paper](/text/project.pdf) [Czech language].

The signal spectrogram is shown on the image below. The 4 cosines are clearly visible.

Another image shows the original signal and identified interfering signals.

The filters are designed effectively filtering the interfering signals.
